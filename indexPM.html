								<h2><a>My PM-38 Boat Build</a></h2>
								<p>This was supposed to be my summer of 2024 project. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the project in 2 months, and I've been slow in finishing it since the school year started. 
									Now I am almost finished and only need to waterproof all the wood and add fiberglass to the hull.

								It is a wooden boat 13.5' long. I got the plans for this boat from a popular mechanics article from 1962. All the wood was from a nearby lumberyard and Home Depot. The boat will be powered by a 1988 Johnson 28 SPL. I am also a high school student, with this being my first experience building something this large. 
								It is far from perfect but is good enough for me.

								I finished frame No. 4 and the transom. They were pretty easy to make and looked good. I had to make and use some gussets for frame No. 4 
								because I didn't think the wood overlapped enough for the lap joint to be as strong as I liked. Everything was fastened together using primarily 1 inch #8 stainless steel Philips screws and epoxy.

								Doing the side planking for the front of the boat was a breeze but the back portion was difficult. I needed extra hands so I used my car jack to prop the plywood up so I could screw it into the chine log. 
								After doing both left and right sides I added the sheer rails (a long thin piece of wood at the bottom of the side planking in image 3)

							<p style="font-size: 22px;">
								I had messed up when doing the sheer rails. One side was much higher than the other and it looked weird. I had cut the side planking to the edge of the sheer rails thinking that both rails would bend the same way. 
								But they hadn't and I only realized that after flipping the boat over. So I decided to just cut off the weird plywood section and add new plywood there, then trace the correct shape and add a new portion of spray rail onto the part where I cut off. 
								(screws sticking out were temporary. I later pulled them out after gluing all the plywood/lap joints together. using 1 inch screws for 2 overlapping 1/4" pieces of plywood is pretty dumb but if it worked I wasn't going to question it)

								I bought my outboard (1988 Johnson 28 SPL) from Facebook marketplace. I did a compression check on each cylinder and they were both fine. But I made a mistake while wiring up the battery to the solenoid where I connected 
								both the positive and negative to the solenoid on each side of it (image 3) because the previous owner labeled a + and - onto it which I misinterpreted. This resulted in a horrible arcing noise and started welding the positive lead onto the battery. 
								I tried finding the right wiring scheme by just looking at the components. I looked at the starter and saw how there was only 1 wire leading into it which I thought was very strange. 
								I researched and saw how the engine block was the ground for the starter, so I only connected the battery's positive to the solenoid and the negative to the block. Then my engine was able to turn over. 
								I later was able to get it running but did not get it on video.

							<p style="font-size: 22px;">
								I cut and screwed the 2 side deck battens on. This step was quite bad, as I couldn't get the wood to bend enough before cracking. I wasted 3 battens like that even though I tried steaming them. 
								One did work, so I got the least cracked batten and added another piece of wood underneath the cracked portion to strengthen it and add it on. That curve was a lot stiffer than the other side but 
								It's not the worst part of this boat.

								I cut out the deck and trimmed it slightly. This step was not the hardest nor easiest. The only annoying part was finding plywood I could use as I didn't store the remaining plywood I had left properly 
								so some were water-damaged. My images show the deck after I unscrewed it off. I also waterproofed the inside of the back section of my boat at some point with a layer of epoxy which can be seen in the third picture (shininess).

							<p style="font-size: 22px;">
								Due to me not finishing sooner this boat now has to endure the rainy season. This caused a lot of mold on the inside of the boat which I hadn't coated with epoxy. At first, I sanded the areas with mold but this became too tedious. I then 
								turned to chemical solutions using vinegar at first, but that did not kill all of it and it grew back. So I used bleach that was diluted and mixed with TSP which seems to have worked so far. The images show the boat being treated with that mixture. 
								Now the boat is just covered with a tarp because of the rain.
